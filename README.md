# NuDiceRoller
Dice Roller App using MEAN Stack

# Isn't this the same dice roller?
Kinda and not. The other one isn't ES6 and was meant to be fairly stand alone and a proof of concept. This is one pretends to be modern and was rebuilt.

# MEAN? What happened to react?
Changed my mind for now.

# MEAN? I see M..N
In progress, the plan for development is as follows:

Get the business logic built and implemented

Build the Routers (Enter Express)

Slap a front end on things (Enter React)
